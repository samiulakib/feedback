               <P>Student Feedback system
Here we have developed the a faculty feedback system, which is generally used in the university to rate the faculty based on the performance...Here we have 2 modules such as administrator, student.

Administrator is the one who creates the student account by adding all student info and assigning the username and password. 
Admin als0 checks the result once all students entered the feedback..
You can perform all admin actions such as login to the account and check result..

If you entere the student user and password and selected student option, then it will show all student information and let you enter the feedback based on the subject..
